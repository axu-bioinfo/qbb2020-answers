Answers section:
1. It looks like the gut bacteria contains mostly lactobacillus, stapholococcus, and actinobacteria along with various other bacteria growing in the gut. Lactobacillus is easily the heaviest populator of the gut across the first week. However, it looks like the populations of the above mentioned bacterial colonies vary drastically from day to day without a consistent trend. This might be caused by host factors, such as diet, or medication use.

2. Contigs can be grouped together by how much coverage a contig got from the sequenced reads samples. Hypothetically, the contigs that come from the same bacterial population should have the same coverage of the reads. We can also try to use the tetranucleotide frequency of each contig to group them together, although I still don't understand the math behind it.

3.
a) After running metabat, I got 6 bins. This is a contrast to the 8 bins provided by the course instructor. I think that this difference might have been due to a difference in software version usage, which can change binning results.
b) According to the metabat2 output, 6 bins (13187322 bases in total) was formed. The total assembly length was around 38071686, so the percentage the bins represent should be roughly around 35% the assembly.
c) Given that the estimated length of a lactobacillus is 1.9 Mb and stapholococcus is 2.8 Mb, the combined lengths of the contigs in each bin (below) is around those sizes, so it seems reasonable.
bin1: 2122579
bin2: 1781136
bin3: 2498405
bin4: 2862852
bin5: 2476955
bin6: 2222805
bin7: 2712304
bin8: 1656034
d) You can measure completeness by running the bins through a predictive software package that will identify putative bacterial genes. You can then compare the predicted genes to a library containing known single copy housekeeping genes for bacteria to get a good idea of how complete the bin is. Contamination can be examined by calculating the GC content of the contigs in the bin. If it is different, it can be due to contamination or possibly due to a genetic island.
#find the length of file >> grep -v ">" file | wc | awk '{print $3-$1}'

a)(Using the 8 bins provided by the course because it will be used later)
bin1: Staphylococcus haemolyticus JCSC1435
bin2: Leuconostoc citreum KM20
bin3: Staphylococcus lugdunensis
bin4: Enterococcus faecalis
bin5: Cutibacterium avidum 44067
bin6: Staphylococcus epidermidis
bin7: Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus
bin8: Peptoniphilaceae
b) The taxonomy of a metagenomic bin can be inferred by finding things such as the 16S or ribosomal protein sequences and running them through a phylogenetic tree to see if there is a consensus of where the proteins are within a certain taxa, which suggests the bin taxonomy.

5. The taxonomy results of the heatmap is more specific than what I could decipher from glancing at the visualisation of the KRAKEN classifications of the reads. The highest abundance found in the heatmap is Enterococcus faecalis which is a lactobacillus, which was found to be the most abundant in the KRAKEN 8 sample visualisations. Peptoniphilaceae did not look as abundant in the KRAKEN visualisation compared to the heatmap results. This could be because the heatmap is only looking at the contigs that have been binned, so some read taxonomy information would have been lost.
